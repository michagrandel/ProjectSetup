**How to write better commit messages**

Replace this text with a description of your Pull request.\
The **first line** in your text should include the **subject** of\
your pull request and should not be longer than *50 characters*.

Separate the subject line from the rest with a **blank line**.\
In the following description text you should describe\
**what** your commit will change and **why** - *Do not describe\
**HOW** you did it!*.

Wrap your description at 72 characters for readability.

Finish your commit message with a change list and \
(if appropriate) a list of issues that are fixed by 
your commit.

The last line should include a mention of a maintainer\
who should review your code.

Summary:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*
